Double click on run.bat and wait for it to start the server.
If you want to use the web app, navigate to http://localhost:3000. Then you can send an email by filling out the fields and submitting.
Alternatively, you can open your email and send an email to fishy@nathanpomana.com that is formatted as follows:
	1. The subject should be in the format:
		Recipient's name,Street Address,City,State(Two letters),Zip-code(Five Numbers),You Name
		(If this format is not followed, the server will break and need to be restarted)
	2. Enter the text in the body exactly how you wish the letter to look.
After this, wait for an email back from fishy that contains a preview of your letter. (The web app will take a longer time to deliver the preview).
